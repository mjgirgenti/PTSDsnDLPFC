# Variant Fine-mapping

We use SuSie to fine-map causal variants at specific PTSD risk loci (riskgenes.csv) using our cell type-specific ATAC CREs. 

Please use `finemap_susie.R` to perform fine-mapping and plot the results with `plot_finemap.R` which uses a customized version of ArchR's plotBrowserTrack function.
